\description{
Missing information imposing on the complete dataset
}
\section{Objects from the Class}{
Objects can be created by \code{simMissing} function. It can also be called from the form \code{new("SimMissing", ...)}.
}
\section{Slots}{
  \describe{
    \item{\code{cov}:}{Column indices of any normally distributed covariates used in the data set.}
    \item{\code{pmMCAR}:}{Decimal percent of missingness to introduce completely at random on all variables.}
    \item{\code{pmMAR}:}{Decimal percent of missingness to introduce using the listed covariates as predictors.}
    \item{\code{nforms}:}{The number of forms for planned missing data designs, not including the shared form.}
    \item{\code{itemGroups}:}{List of lists of item groupings for planned missing data forms. Without this, items will be divided into groups sequentially (e.g. 1-3,4-6,7-9,10-12)}
    \item{\code{twoMethod}:}{Vector of (percent missing, column index). Will put a given percent
		missing on that column in the matrix to simulate a two method
		planned missing data research design. }
    \item{\code{timePoints}:}{Number of timepoints items were measured over. For longitudinal data, planned missing designs will be implemented within each timepoint.}
    \item{\code{numImps}:}{The number of imputations to be used when multiply imputing missing data. Setting numImps to 0 will use FIML to handle missing data.}
    \item{\code{impMethod}:}{Package that will be used for imputation. Currently only Amelia is supported.}
	\item{\code{ignoreCols}:}{The columns not imposed any missing values for any missing data patterns} 
	\item{\code{threshold}:}{The threshold of covariates that divide between the area to impose missing and the area not to impose missing. The default threshold is the mean of the covariate.}
	\item{\code{prAttr}:}{Probability (or vector of probabilities) of an entire case being removed due to attrition at a given time point. See \code{\link{imposeMissing}} for further details.}
	\item{\code{covAsAux}:}{If \code{TRUE}, the covariate listed in the object will be used as auxiliary variables when putting in the model object. If \code{FALSE}, the covariate will be included in the analysis.}
	\item{\code{logical}:}{A matrix of logical values (\code{TRUE/FALSE}). If a value in the dataset is corresponding to the \code{TRUE} in the logical matrix, the value will be missing.}
}

	\itemize{
		\item \code{\link{summary}} To summarize the object
