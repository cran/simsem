\title{
	Provide a comparison of nested models across replications
}
\description{
	This function will provide averages of model fit statistics and indices for nested models. It will also provide average differences of fit indices and power for likelihood ratio tests of nested models.

%\usage{
%anova(object, ...)

\arguments{
  \item{object}{
	\code{\linkS4class{SimResult}} object being described. Currently at least two objects must be included as arguments
}
  \item{\dots}{
    any additional arguments, such as additional objects or for the function with result object
}
}
\value{
	A data frame that provides the statistics described above from all parameters.
	For using with \code{\linkS4class{SimModelOut}}, each column means
	\itemize{
		\item \code{Chisq.diff:} Average chi square difference across all replications
		\item \code{Df.diff:} Average degrees of freedom difference across all replications
		\item \code{Power:} The proportion of replications where the likelihood ratio test is significant
		\item \code{CFI.diff:} Average difference of the CFI across all replications
		\item \code{TLI.diff:} Average difference of the TLI across all replications
		\item \code{RMSEA.diff:} Average difference of the RMSEA across all replications
