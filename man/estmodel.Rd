\title{
	Shortcut for data analysis template for simulation.
}
\description{
	Creates a data analysis template (lavaan parameter table) for simulations with structural equation models based on Y-side LISREL design matrices. Each corresponds to a LISREL matrix, but must be a matrix or a vector. In addition to the usual Y-side matrices in LISREL, both PS and TE can be specified using correlations (RPS, RTE) and scaled by a vector of residual variances (VTE, VPS) or total variances (VY, VE). Multiple groups are supported by passing lists of matrices or vectors to arguments, or by specifying the number of groups.

\details{
This function contains default settings:

For \code{modelType="CFA"}, \code{LY} is required. As the default, the on-diagonal elements of \code{PS} are fixed as 1 and the off-diagonal elements of \code{PS} are freely estimated. The off-diagonal elements of \code{TE} are freely estimated and the off-diagonal elements of \code{TE} are fixed to 0. The \code{AL} elements are fixed to 0. The \code{TY} elements are freely estimated.

For \code{modelType="Path"}, \code{BE} is required. As the default, the on-diagonal elements of \code{PS} are freely estimated, the off-diagonal elements between exogenous variables (covariance between exogenous variables) are freely estimated, and the other off-diagonal elements are fixed to 0. The \code{AL} elements are freely estimated. 

For \code{modelType="SEM"}, \code{LY} and \code{BE} are required. As the default, the on-diagonal elements of \code{PS} are fixed to 1, the off-diagonal elements between exogenous factors (covariance between exogenous factors) are freely estimated, and the other off-diagonal elements are fixed to 0. The off-diagonal elements of \code{TE} are freely estimated and the off-diagonal elements of \code{TE} are fixed to 0. The \code{AL} elements are fixed to 0. The \code{TY} elements are freely estimated.

The \code{estmodel.cfa}, \code{estmodel.path}, and \code{estmodel.sem} are the shortcuts for the \code{estmodel} function when \code{modelType} are \code{"CFA"}, \code{"Path"}, and \code{"SEM"}, respectively.
