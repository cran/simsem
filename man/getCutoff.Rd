\title{
	Find fit indices cutoff given a priori alpha level
}
\description{
	Extract fit indices information from the \code{\linkS4class{SimResult}} and get the cutoffs of fit indices given a priori alpha level
}
\usage{
getCutoff(object, alpha, revDirec = FALSE, usedFit = NULL, nVal = NULL, 
	pmMCARval = NULL, pmMARval = NULL, df = 0)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{
	\code{\linkS4class{SimResult}} that saves the analysis results from multiple replications
}
  \item{alpha}{
	A priori alpha level
}
  \item{revDirec}{
	The default is to find criticl point on the side that indicates worse fit (the right side of RMSEA or the left side of CFI). If specifying as \code{TRUE}, the directions are reversed.
}
  \item{usedFit}{
	Vector of names of fit indices that researchers wish to getCutoffs from. The default is to getCutoffs of all fit indices.
  }
  \item{nVal}{
	The sample size value that researchers wish to find the fit indices cutoffs from. This argument is applicable for \code{\linkS4class{SimResult}} with varying sample sizes or percent missing across replications
  }
  \item{pmMCARval}{
	The percent missing completely at random value that researchers wish to find the fit indices cutoffs from. This argument is applicable for \code{\linkS4class{SimResult}} with varying sample sizes or percent missing across replications
  }
  \item{pmMARval}{
	The percent missing at random value that researchers wish to find the fit indices cutoffs from. This argument is applicable for \code{\linkS4class{SimResult}} with varying sample sizes or percent missing across replications
  }
  \item{df}{
	The degree of freedom used in spline method in predicting the fit indices by the predictors. If \code{df} is 0, the spline method will not be applied. This argument is applicable for \code{\linkS4class{SimResult}} with varying sample sizes or percent missing across replications
  }
}
\value{
	One-tailed cutoffs of several fit indices with a priori alpha level
