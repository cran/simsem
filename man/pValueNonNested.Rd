\title{
	Find p-values (1 - percentile) for a non-nested model comparison
}
\description{
	This function will provide \emph{p} value from comparing the results of fitting real data into two models against the simulation from fitting the simulated data from both models into both models. The \emph{p} values from both sampling distribution under the datasets from the first and the second models are reported.

	If \code{TRUE}, the function will convert the \emph{p} value based on two-tailed test. 
}
}
\value{
	This function provides a vector of \emph{p} values based on the comparison of the difference in fit indices from the real data with the simulation results. The \emph{p} values of fit indices are provided, as well as two additional values: \code{andRule} and \code{orRule}. The \code{andRule} is based on the principle that the model is retained only when all fit indices provide good fit. The proportion is calculated from the number of replications that have all fit indices indicating a better model than the observed data. The proportion from the \code{andRule} is the most stringent rule in retaining a hypothesized model. The \code{orRule} is based on the principle that the model is retained only when at least one fit index provides good fit. The proportion is calculated from the number of replications that have at least one fit index indicating a better model than the observed data. The proportion from the \code{orRule} is the most lenient rule in retaining a hypothesized model.
}
\details{
	In comparing fit indices, the \emph{p} value is the proportion of the number of replications that provide less preference for either model 1 or model 2 than the analysis result from the observed data. In two-tailed test, the function will report the proportion of values under the sampling distribution that are more extreme that one obtained from real data. If the resulting \code{p} value is high (> .05) on one model and low (< .05) in the other model, the model with high \code{p} value is preferred. If the \code{p} values are both high or both low, the decision is undetermined.
