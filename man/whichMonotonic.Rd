\title{
	Extract a part of a vector that is monotonically increasing or decreasing
}
\description{
	Extract a part of a vector that is monotonically increasing or decreasing. This function will go to the anchor value and extract the neighbor values that are monotonically increasing or decreasing.
}
\usage{
whichMonotonic(vec, ord=NULL, anchor=NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{vec}{
	The target vector to be extracted
}
  \item{ord}{
	The names of each element of the vector to be attached
}
  \item{anchor}{
	The position of the element to be anchored. The default value is the middle position.
}
}
\value{
	The monotonic part of a vector
